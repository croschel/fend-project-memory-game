## Instructions

This is a software developed with HTML 5, CSS 3 and Javascript for a project in Udacity.

## Rules

You will have to find all the cards matching them like a tradicional memory game. You will have infinity attempts to
do this, but you will have a score panel that will gonna check in the final your skills. Basically you have to turn 
and match all the with the less time that you can. If you pass for 30 movements without turn all the cards you will lost a star and when you get more than 40 movements you will lose the second one. When you win the game, a window will appear for you with your score. If you want to come back and try again it's pretty easy, you just have to click on the restart symbol on the right side of the timer. 

## Installation

You don't need to install nothing for play this game, you only need a browser, preferably google chrome. Click on
index.html and start to play.
